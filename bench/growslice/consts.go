	// heapAddrBits is the number of bits in a heap address. On

	// other arches, they are zero-extended.
	//
	// On most 64-bit platforms, we limit this to 48 bits based on a
	// combination of hardware and OS limitations.
	//
	// amd64 hardware limits addresses to 48 bits, sign-extended
	// to 64 bits. Addresses where the top 16 bits are not either
	// all 0 or all 1 are "non-canonical" and invalid. Because of
	// these "negative" addresses, we offset addresses by 1<<47
	// (arenaBaseOffset) on amd64 before computing indexes into
	// the heap arenas index. In 2017, amd64 hardware added
	// support for 57 bit addresses; however, currently only Linux
	// supports this extension and the kernel will never choose an
	// address above 1<<47 unless mmap is called with a hint
	// address above 1<<47 (which we never do).
	//
	// arm64 hardware (as of ARMv8) limits user addresses to 48
	// bits, in the range [0, 1<<48).
	//
	// ppc64, mips64, and s390x support arbitrary 64 bit addresses
	// in hardware. On Linux, Go leans on stricter OS limits. Based
	// on Linux's processor.h, the user address space is limited as
	// follows on 64-bit architectures:
	//
	// Architecture  Name              Maximum Value (exclusive)
	// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
	// amd64         TASK_SIZE_MAX     0x007ffffffff000 (47 bit addresses)
	// arm64         TASK_SIZE_64      0x01000000000000 (48 bit addresses)
	// ppc64{,le}    TASK_SIZE_USER64  0x00400000000000 (46 bit addresses)
	// mips64{,le}   TASK_SIZE64       0x00010000000000 (40 bit addresses)
	// s390x         TASK_SIZE         1<<64 (64 bit addresses)
	//
	// These limits may increase over time, but are currently at
	// most 48 bits except on s390x. On all architectures, Linux
	// starts placing mmap'd regions at addresses that are
	// significantly below 48 bits, so even if it's possible to
	// exceed Go's 48 bit limit, it's extremely unlikely in
	// practice.
	//
	// On 32-bit platforms, we accept the full 32-bit address
	// space because doing so is cheap.
	// mips32 only has access to the low 2GB of virtual memory, so
	// we further limit it to 31 bits.
	//
	// On ios/arm64, although 64-bit pointers are presumably
	// available, pointers are truncated to 33 bits in iOS <14.
	// Furthermore, only the top 4 GiB of the address space are
	// actually available to the application. In iOS >=14, more
	// of the address space is available, and the OS can now
	// provide addresses outside of those 33 bits. Pick 40 bits
	// as a reasonable balance between address space usage by the
	// page allocator, and flexibility for what mmap'd regions
	// we'll accept for the heap. We can't just move to the full
	// 48 bits because this uses too much address space for older
	// iOS versions.
	// TODO(mknyszek): Once iOS <14 is deprecated, promote ios/arm64
	// to a 48-bit address space like every other arm64 platform.
